## Basic knowledge
DNS over HTTPS(DoH) protocol is that the communication is encrypted using built-in application HTTPS standards. It was first introduced in October 2018 (IETF RFC 8484) with a goal of increasing user security and privacy. With DNS over HTTPS (DoH), DNS queries and responses are encrypted and sent via the HTTP or HTTP/2 protocols. DoH ensures that attackers cannot forge or alter DNS traffic. DoH uses port 443, the standard HTTPS traffic port, to wrap the DNS query in an HTTPS request.

### Pros of DoH
*	Encrypting DNS name resolution traffic helps to hide your online activities.
*	Prevent DNS spoofing and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks
*	Protect sensitive information that DNS hijacking methodologies employ and obfuscate data that could be sniffed by third-party observers and ISPs.
*	load time performance is typically improved.


### Cons of DoH
*	Overrides any sort of DNS filtering your network is doing to provide insight into security and your network info
*	False-negative security flags and blocked queries can be generated if the system administrator is unfamiliar with DoH or similar protocols
